## üöÄ Getting Started

There is no complex setup required! Since this is a pure front-end application, you can run it in two ways:

### 1. Directly in Your Browser

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ashonko/MY_URL.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MY_REPO_NAME
    ```
3.  Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

### 2. Using a Local Server (Recommended for development)

For the best experience during development (to avoid potential browser security issues with `fetch`), it's recommended to use a simple local server.

1.  Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2.  Install the `live-server` package globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g live-server
    ```
3.  From the project's root directory, run:
    ```bash
    live-server
    ```
    This will automatically open the app in your browser and reload it whenever you make changes to the code.
